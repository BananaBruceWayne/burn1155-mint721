# Burn an ERC1155 to Mint an ERC721 NFT

Similar to the [Mutant Ape Yacht Club](https://opensea.io/collection/mutant-ape-yacht-club) collection, this template shows you how to:

1. Build a simple ERC721A Drop Contract - Mimicking the original [BAYC Collection](https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub)
2. Build an ERC1155 Contract - Mimicking the [Serum NFT Collection](https://opensea.io/collection/bored-ape-chemistry-club) 
3. Create an ERC721 Drop with restrictions on who can claim, based on their ownership of the two above collections.
